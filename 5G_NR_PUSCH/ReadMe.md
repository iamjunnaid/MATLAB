# MATLAB Codes for 5G NR PUSCH Analysis

This folder contains MATLAB codes for analyzing the 5G NR (New Radio) Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH). The tasks focus on Doppler shift, delay spread, and throughput performance under different configurations.

---

## Tasks Overview

### **T1. Maximum Supported Doppler Shift**
- Generate throughput plots with curves showing the **maximum supported Doppler shift** under varying conditions.

### **T2. Extending the Range of Supported Doppler Shift**
- Demonstrate techniques to **extend the range of supported Doppler shift** and evaluate their impact on system performance.

### **T3. Doppler Shift Estimation Algorithm**
- Implement a **Doppler shift estimation algorithm** and plot a curve showing its accuracy with different delay spread values.

### **T4. Maximum Supported Delay Spread**
- Generate throughput plots to determine the **maximum supported delay spread** for subcarrier spacings of **15 kHz** and **30 kHz**.

### **T5. Delay Spread with DMRS Configuration Type 2**
- Repeat the delay spread plot for **15 kHz subcarrier spacing**, but with **DMRSConfigurationType = 2**, and determine the **maximum supported delay spread**.
